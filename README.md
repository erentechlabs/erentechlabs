### 🚀 About Me

I'm a developer who loves creating **meaningful, user-focused applications** — whether it's building sleek desktop tools with **WPF**, crafting clean mobile UIs with **Flutter**, or designing powerful backend systems using **Spring Boot**.

I enjoy solving real-world problems with elegant code and thoughtful design. I’m also a big fan of clean architecture, maintainability, and continuous learning.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing and analyzing games, discovering indie gems, and currently expanding my horizons by studying **Justice** part-time.
